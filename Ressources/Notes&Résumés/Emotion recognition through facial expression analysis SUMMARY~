1.1. Review of facial expression recognition
Since the early 1970s, Ekman and Friesen (1975) have
performed extensive studies of human facial expressions,
providing evidence to support this universality theory.
These ‘universal facial expressions’ are those representing
happiness, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, and disgust. To
prove this, they provide results from studying facial
expressions in different cultures, even primitive or isolated
ones. These studies show that the processes of expression
and recognition of emotions on the face are common
enough, despite differences imposed by social rules.
Ekman and Friesen used FACS to manually describe facial
expressions, using still images of, usually extreme, facial
expressions. This work inspired researchers to analyze
facial expressions by tracking prominent facial features or
measuring the amount of facial movement, usually relying
on the ‘universal expressions’ or a defined subset of them.

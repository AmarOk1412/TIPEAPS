PASSAGES INTERESSANTS:
Anger is one of the emotions that negatively affect one's driving. When drivers become angry,
they start feeling self-righteous about events and anger impairs their normal thinking and judgment, their perception
is altered, thus leading to the misinterpretation of events (James, 2000). Other states that lead to negative effects are
frustration, anxiety, fear, and stress (Fuller & Santos, 2002). In order to be a safer driver on the highways, a person
needs to be better aware of her emotions and possess the ability to manage them effectively (James, 2000).

Another example is, sleepiness, which is one of the most dangerous states
to be in while driving, yet when people find they are sleepy, they often force themselves to continue driving instead
of stopping to rest (James, 2000).

PASSAGES INTERESSANTS
CAT creates a continuous, low dimensional eigenspace of ex-
pressions, which allows the creation of expressions of different
intensity (including ones more intense than those in the original
recordings) and combining different expressions to create new
ones

FIGURES INTERESSANTES
Figure 3: Schematic of Cluster Adaptive Training. The clus-
ters in CAT form the bases of an emotion-space, and the weights
λ i are the coordinates. Subtle, extreme and new combined ex-
pressions are achieved by moving around the space.
Figure 4: Emotion recognition study. Recognition rates in
percent for real video cropped to the face and for the synthe-
sised avatar. In each case 10 sentences in each emotion were
evaluated by 20 people.

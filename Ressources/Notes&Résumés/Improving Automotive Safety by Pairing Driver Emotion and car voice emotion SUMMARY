PASSAGES INTERESSANTS:
First, how should one assess the emotion of drivers?
Future research should explore a number of possibilities
including cameras to detect facial expression, sensors
attached to the steering wheel, and voice analysis (made
more effective when the car voice encourages
conversation). Of course, changes in driving emotion
during the session are also critica

The current study only examined two basic driver
emotions—happy versus sad—and two basic voice
emotions—aroused or subdued. Clearly, there are many
other dimensions of emotion that should be explored.
Beyond emotion, it is important to consider other aspects
of driver characteristics and how they might interact with
the car voice, including personality, gender, ethnicity, etc.

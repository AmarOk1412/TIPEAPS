PASSAGES INTERESSANTS:
Most face recognition algorithms are designed to work
best with well aligned, well illuminated, and frontal pose
face images.

Algorithms that use local
appearance descriptors are more robust against occlusion,
expression variation, pose variation and small sample sizes
than traditional holistic algorithms [4], [5].

LBP are invariant against monotonic gray-
scale transformations, they are still affected by illumination
changes that induce non monotonic gray-scale changes such
as self shadowing

Le gradient peut être intéressant pour traiter une image
(Pour corriger la lumière ils font une correction Gamma + différence gaussienne)

Ils décrivent surtout leurs algo qu'on utilisera pas (NNBN)


FIGURES INTERESSANTES:
Figure 1. The upper row shows three images of a subject from the Yale B
dataset under different lighting conditions. The bottom row shows the same
images after processing with Tan and Triggs’ illumination normalization
algorithm. Appearance variation due to lighting is drastically reduced.


Figure 2. The LBP operator thresholds each pixel against its neighboring
pixels and interprets the result as a binary number. In the bottom image
each gray-level value corresponds to a different local binary pattern.

Figure 3. LBP descriptors are built by partitioning the LBP face image into
a grid and computing LBP histograms over each grid cell. These histograms
may then be concatenated into a vector or treated as individual descriptors.
